### Issue #5: LangGraph debate state machine
**Labels:** `feature`, `priority: high`  
**Milestone:** Sprint 1  
**Assignee:** Jason  
**Depends on:** #4

#### Description
Core debate orchestration as a LangGraph state machine with nodes for all 7 phases (including internal evaluation phases).

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `DebateState` TypedDict tracks: debate_id, topic, status, current_phase, debate_turns, evidence_bundle (shared Pro + Con), personas
- [ ] Graph nodes for full pipeline: `research_consultation` → `opening_pro` → `opening_con` → `eval_openings` → `rebuttal_pro` → `rebuttal_con` → `eval_full_debate` → `closing_pro` → `closing_con` → `judging` → `complete`
- [ ] Internal phases (research_consultation, eval_openings, eval_full_debate) produce strategic analysis output but do NOT stream to user by default
- [ ] Streamed phases (opening, rebuttal, closing) emit SSE events with argument content
- [ ] Phase transition events sent between phases (including transition messages for internal phases)
- [ ] Debate status updates in database at each transition
- [ ] Unit tests verify state machine transitions with mocked agents

### Issue #6: Dynamic persona generation + debate agent prompts
**Labels:** `feature`, `priority: high`  
**Milestone:** Sprint 1  
**Assignee:** Jason  
**Depends on:** #4, #5

#### Description
Build the prompt construction system: dynamic persona generation (tailored to topic + evidence), phase-specific instructions, shared evidence injection, and internal evaluation prompts. Agents should appeal to values and argue persuasively, not produce dry academic output.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `persona_generator.py` generates a tailored advocate persona based on topic and evidence (via Claude Haiku) — not a fixed character
- [ ] System prompt includes: dynamic persona, assigned position (re-injected every phase), commitment device, steelmanning requirement, instruction to appeal to values
- [ ] **Research consultation prompt:** Agent receives ALL research, identifies strengths/vulnerabilities/opponent strategy/source conflicts
- [ ] **Opening prompt:** Agent presents case with citations, hasn't seen opponent's opening
- [ ] **Eval openings prompt (internal):** Agent reads opponent's opening, assesses sources, plans rebuttal — output stored but not streamed
- [ ] **Rebuttal prompt:** Steelman → respond → challenge evidence → introduce new sources → connect to values
- [ ] **Eval full debate prompt (internal):** Agent reflects on all arguments, plans closing — output stored but not streamed
- [ ] **Closing prompt:** Acknowledge opponent, name core disagreement, synthesize, address hardest question, close with impact
- [ ] All prompts use minimums (not maximums) for length and sources — as long as needed
- [ ] Evidence passed with `[Source: Title](URL)` citation markers so agents can reference specific sources
- [ ] Unit tests verify prompt construction includes all required components per phase

### Issue #7: SSE streaming endpoint for debate
**Labels:** `feature`, `priority: high`  
**Milestone:** Sprint 1  
**Assignee:** Shuai  
**Depends on:** #5

#### Description
Server-Sent Events endpoint that streams debate content to the frontend as the debate progresses, including phase transitions and internal phase notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `GET /debates/{id}/stream` returns SSE stream (content-type: text/event-stream)
- [ ] Streamed phases: argument content sent token-by-token as SSE events
- [ ] Internal phases: transition event sent (type: "phase_transition", message: "Agents evaluating...")
- [ ] Internal phase strategic analysis available via separate endpoint (hidden by default, viewable on request)
- [ ] Stream includes metadata: current phase, speaker (pro/con), phase type (streamed vs internal)
- [ ] Stream ends with completion event
- [ ] Frontend SSE handler connects, processes events, handles reconnection
- [ ] Integration test verifies events sent in correct order for complete debate

---

**Labels:** `feature`, `priority: high`  
**Milestone:** Sprint 1  
**Assignee:** Shuai  
**Depends on:** #1

#### Description

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Displays app title, tagline, topic input field (dark theme, gradient title per mockup)
- [ ] 3+ preset topic cards fetched from `GET /topics/presets`
- [ ] Clicking a preset navigates to `/debates/[id]` and launches debate
- [ ] "How it works" shows 7-phase flow: Research → Opening → Eval → Rebuttal → Eval → Closing → Judging
- [ ] Styled with TailwindCSS matching v3 mockup
- [ ] Component test verifies preset topics render and are clickable

### Issue #9: Frontend — Live debate view with streaming
**Labels:** `feature`, `priority: high`  
**Milestone:** Sprint 1  
**Assignee:** Shuai  
**Depends on:** #7, #8

#### Description
Split-screen debate view with streaming arguments, 7-phase navigation, citation badges with clickable source URLs, internal phase transition messages, and "Show strategic analysis" toggle.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Split-screen: Pro (left, blue) and Con (right, red) with dynamic persona names/roles
- [ ] Arguments stream token-by-token with cursor animation
- [ ] Phase nav bar shows all 7 phases — internal phases styled differently (italic/muted)
- [ ] Completed phases clickable to review earlier arguments
- [ ] Internal phases show transition message + spinner + "🧠 Show strategic analysis" toggle
- [ ] Strategic analysis panels display in monospace, collapsible, visually distinct from arguments
